Introduction to MongoDB
-----------------------


MongoDB is a document database designed for ease of development and scaling . It is one of the most powerful
NoSQL system and database . Being a NoSQL means that it does not use the usual rows and columns . This
database uses a document storage format called BSON which is a binary style of JSON documents .

Example :
{
_id : ObjectId ( " 6abs665jhsj7 " ) ,
name : " Sonam " ,
age : 27 ,
hobbies : [ ' Dancing ' , ' Reading " ] ,
city : " Ranchi " ,
isLogin : true
}

MongoDB
-------


Database - In MongoDB , databases hold one or more collections .

Collection - MongoDB stores documents in collections . Collections are analogous to tables in relational databases .

Document - A document is a set of key - value pairs . The documents in a single collection do not need to have the
same set of fields and the data type for a field can differ across documents within a collection .



MongoDB Deployment Options
--------------------------


• Locally Hosted Deployments
  • MongoDB Community (free)
  • MongoDB Enterprise Advance (paid)

• Cloud Hosted Deployment
  • MongoDB Atlas


MongoDB Terms
-------------

mongo - mongo is the command - line shell that connects to a specific instance of mongod . When you run mongo
with no parameters it defaults to connecting to the localhost on port 27017 .

mongod - mongod is the primary daemon process for the MongoDB system . It handles data requests , manages
data access , and performs background management operations .

mongos - For a sharded cluster , the mongos instances provide the interface between the client applications and
the sharded cluster . The mongos instances route queries and write operations to the shards . From the perspective
of the application , a mongos instance behaves identically to any other MongoDB instance .

mongosh - The MongoDB Shell , mongosh , is a fully functional JavaScript and Node.js 14.x REPL environment
for interacting with MongoDB deployments . You can use the MongoDB Shell to test queries and operations
directly with your database .

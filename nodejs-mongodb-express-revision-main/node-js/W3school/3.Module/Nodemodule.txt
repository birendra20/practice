# What is a Module in Node.js?

Consider modules to be the same as JavaScript libraries.

A set of functions you want to include in your application.

Include Modules
To include a module, use the require() function with the name of the module:

var http = require('http');

Now your application has access to the HTTP module, and is able to create a server:

http.createServer(function (req, res) {
  res.writeHead(200, {'Content-Type': 'text/html'});
  res.end('Hello World!');
}).listen(8080);

Create Your Own Modules

You can create your own modules, and easily include them in your applications.

The following example creates a module that returns a date and time object:

exports.myDateTime = function () {
  return Date();
};

Use the exports keyword to make properties and methods available outside the module file.

//Props are inputs to components.
//They are single values or objects containing a set of values that are passed to components
//on creation using a naming convention similar to HTML-tag attributes.
//They are data passed down from a parent component to a child component.

//The primary purpose of props in React is to provide following component functionality:
//i. Pass custom data to your component.
//ii. Trigger state changes.
//iii. Use via this.props.reactProp inside component's render() method.
//For example, let us create an element with reactProp property:
//<Element reactProp={'1'} />

//This reactProp (or whatever you came up with) name then becomes a property attached to React's native props object
// which originally already exists on all components created using React library.

props.reactProp;
